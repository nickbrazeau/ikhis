# HR-VILAGE-3K3M: Human Respiratory Viral Immunization Longitudinal Gene Expression

This repository provides the HR-VILAGE-3K3M dataset, a curated collection of human longitudinal gene expression profiles, antibody measurements, and aligned metadata from respiratory viral immunization and infection studies. The dataset includes baseline transcriptomic profiles and covers diverse exposure types (vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposure). HR-VILAGE-3K3M is designed as a benchmark resource to support the development and evaluation of deep learning models for longitudinal gene expression analysis and to facilitate research into the temporal dynamics of immune responses.

# Update

***Sep 9, 2025*** We corrected technical issues in GSE194378_gene_expr.csv, GSE199750_gene_expr.csv, and GSE276544_gene_expr.csv. These files have been re-uploaded, and users are advised to re-run analyses if relying on them.

***Oct 13, 2025*** Data repo V2 release
1. GSE169159_gene_expr.csv: updated to incorporate the authors’ latest data revision.
2. GSE230494_antibody.csv: added antibody measurements and updated the corresponding metadata.
3. study_meta: updated to include the number of genes and timepoint information; added Meta_variable_description.csv.

***Aug 28, 2026*** Data repo V3 release
1. Removed `bulk_gene_expr_raw/`. The raw, study-author-provided expression files are no longer redistributed here; they remain available from the original source records.
2. Added `study_citations.csv`, giving the source-publication citation, the dataset citation, and a direct link to the original record at GEO, ArrayExpress, or ImmPort for each of the 66 studies. **This is where to obtain the raw data for a study.** You can browse it in the Dataset Viewer above by selecting the `study_citations` config.
3. The dataset is now released under CC-BY-4.0 and has a DOI, [10.57967/hf/9892](https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/9892).

# Dataset Description:
- This repo contains 66 studies (59 bulk and 7 single cell studies), comprising 3178 subjects and 14,136 observations along with 2,557,942 single cells.
- We provide preprocessed and normalized gene expression data, metadata and antibody data. Raw source files are not redistributed here; `study_citations.csv` cites and links each study's original record.

# Dataset Viewer:
The Dataset Viewer at the top of this page previews only the small tabular files. The full expression matrices are too large to display there and must be downloaded (see **How to start** below). Choose a config from the dropdown:

| Config | Contents |
|---|---|
| `study_meta` (default) | Study-level overview of all 66 studies: platform, tissue, study type, pathogen, vaccine, subject / observation / gene / cell counts, and timepoints. |
| `study_citations` | Source-publication and dataset citations for all 66 studies, plus links to the transcriptomic data, metadata, and antibody data at GEO, ArrayExpress, or ImmPort. **Use this to locate the raw data for a study**, which is not redistributed in this repository. |
| `Meta_variable_description` | Definitions of the 49 variables used in the per-study `meta/` files. |
| `example_meta` | Metadata for one study (GSE194378): 386 samples x 50 columns. |
| `example_bulk_gene_expr` | Expression excerpt for the same study: 386 samples x the first 25 gene columns (full files carry 41,667). |
| `example_antibody` | Antibody measurements for the same study: 72 subjects x 16 strain/timepoint endpoints. |

- **study_meta.csv**: Contains study-level metadata (e.g., platform, tissue type, study type) and serves as an overview of the repository. Users can use this file to filter and select a subset of studies based on custom criteria.
- **study_citations.csv**: Per-study provenance for all 66 studies: the source publication citation, the dataset citation for the original record, and links to the transcriptomic data, metadata, and antibody data at the source repository. **This is where to find the raw data for a given study**, which is not redistributed in this repository. Browse it in the Dataset Viewer above by selecting the `study_citations` config, or join it to `study_meta.csv` on `study_ID`.
- **bulk_gene_expr/**: Processed gene expression matrices for each study (sample-by-gene). All files share the same 41,667 gene columns, with 9,004 genes non-missing across all studies.
- **singel_cell_gene_expr/**: Processed single cell gene expression matrices for each study in h5ad format. Raw count matrices are stored in the .X attribute, and cell-level metadata is stored in the .obs dataframe. 
- **meta/**: Study-specific metadata files (.csv), aligned by row names with the corresponding expression data. All metadata files share the same column structure; missing values are marked as NA.
- **antibody/**: Raw antibody measurements with sample IDs matching those in the metadata, enabling integration with gene expression data at the subject level.

# How to start:
Users could directly download all files and read files locally.

Alternatively, the following provides (partially) loading the dataset into Python using `dataset` package.
```python
repo_id = "xuejun72/HR-VILAGE-3K3M"
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset
```
## Bulk gene expression data
Bulk gene expression data can be loaded and combined using two alternative approaches.

1. Use our predefined configuration name, and pass to `name` argument in `load_dataset()`. `trust_remote_code=True` and `revision="script"` are required.

   Example 1, to download study_meta:
   ```python
   study_meta = load_dataset(repo_id, name="study_meta", trust_remote_code=True, revision="script")["train"].to_pandas()
   ```
   Example 2, to download and combine **all** meta datasets:
   ```python
   meta_dict = load_dataset(repo_id, name = "meta", trust_remote_code=True, revision="script")
   meta = meta_dict["train"].to_pandas()
   ```
   Example 3, to download and combine **all** bulk gene expression datasets. However, this is highly **NOT** recommended since their size are too large and the execution time will be long.
   ```python
   # Not recommended!
   gene_expr_dict = load_dataset(repo_id, name = "bulk_gene_expr", trust_remote_code=True, revision="script")
   ```

   In addition, we provide a study filter function before downloading and loading, which works for **meta** and **bulk gene expression** datasets.
   `split_filter` argument is designed for this filter, which is optional. By default, `split_filter=None` will download all datasets as shown before.
   `split_filter` is a `dict` Python object where `key` is filter factors taking values from `['study_type','platform','tissue','pathogen','vaccine']` and `value` is a list of categories for each `key`. `value` should be exact same as that in study_meta.csv.
   Some examples of a valid `split_filter`:
   ```python
   split_filter = {"study_type": ["inoculation","inoculation"]}
   split_filter = {"study_type": ["vaccine"], "vaccine": ["Influenza TIV"]}
   split_filter = {"study_type": ["vaccine"], "platform": ["RNA-seq"], "tissue": ["PBMC","nasal swab"], "pathogen": []}
   ```
   Example 4, to download and combine a customized filtered meta dataset:
   ```python
   split_filter = {"study_type": ["vaccine"], "platform": ["RNA-seq"], "tissue": ["PBMC","nasal swab"], "pathogen": []}
   meta_filtered_dict = load_dataset(repo_id, name = "meta", trust_remote_code=True, split_filter=split_filter, revision="script")
   for _, value in meta_filtered_dict.items(): 
     meta_filtered = value.to_pandas().set_index("row_name")
   meta_filtered
   ```
   Example 5, to download and combine a customized filtered bulk gene expression dataset:
   ```python
   split_filter = {"study_type": ["vaccine"], "platform": ["RNA-seq"], "tissue": ["PBMC","nasal swab"], "pathogen": []}
   gene_expr_filtered_dict = load_dataset(repo_id, name = "bulk_gene_expr", trust_remote_code=True, split_filter=split_filter, revision="script")
   gene_names = gene_expr_filtered_dict["gene_expr_colnames"][0]["gene_names"]
   all_row_names = []
   all_matrix = []
   for batch in next(iter(gene_expr_filtered_dict.items()))[1]:
     all_row_names.extend(batch["row_names"])
     all_matrix.extend(batch["matrix"])
   gene_expr_filtered = pd.DataFrame(all_matrix, index=all_row_names, columns=gene_names)
   gene_expr_filtered
   ```
2. Use exact path of one csv file, and pass to `data_files` argument in `load_dataset()`.

   Example 1, to download study_meta:
   ```python
   study_meta = load_dataset(repo_id, data_files = "study_meta.csv")["train"].to_pandas()
   ```
   Example 2, to download antibody dataset for GSE194378:
   ```python
   antibody = load_dataset(repo_id, data_files = "antibody/GSE194378_antibody.csv")["train"].to_pandas()
   ```
   Note: for **antibody** datasets, since different study has different columns which cannot be simply combined, loading them must using `data_files` argument and be one-by-one.

## Single cell gene expression data
Single-cell gene expression data can be downloaded and accessed using the anndata package.

  ```python
    import anndata as ad
    # Load the GSE195673 dataset
    GSE195673 = ad.read_h5ad("./GSE195673_processed.h5ad")
    # View cell-level metadata
    GSE195673.obs
  ```
A merged dataset containing all 7 studies is also provided, comprising 2,557,942 cells and 13,589 common genes:
  ```python
    import anndata as ad
    # Load the combined dataset
    combined = ad.read_h5ad("./combined.h5ad")
    # View cell-level metadata
    combined.obs
  ```
The combined object includes detailed cell-level metadata such as sample_id, cell_type, sex, donor_id, time_point_day, dataset, covid_status, age, tissue, and study_type. It also contains dimensionality reductions (X_pca, X_umap) and graph-based neighbor information in obsp for downstream analysis.

The studies grouped below originate from the same research group and were typically processed using consistent experimental and technical pipelines. Consequently, these studies are expected to exhibit minimal batch effects compared to those conducted independently. We provide this grouping information to assist users interested in pooling data across studies—combining studies from the same group can help mitigate confounding technical variability and enhance statistical power in downstream analyses such as differential expression. Notably, GSE201533 and GSE201534 represent paired bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data from the same subjects, while GSE246937 is paired with GSE246525, offering a valuable opportunity for multi-resolution analyses.
